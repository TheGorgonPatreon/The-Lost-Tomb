You can find more assets like this at our patreon: https://www.patreon.com/The_Gorgon</p><p>Inside this map you will find animated flames, custom sounds/music, and animated sarcophagi. The more decorated sarcophagus in the main chamber is the one we consider the boss while the ones hidden in the northern section we consider the lesser sarcophagi. Each can be activated using Monks Active Tile Trigger and the lights must have the module Tagger. <strong>You must have both installed and activated for this module to function properly!</strong></p><h2>Activating the Tiles</h2><ol><li><p>Once the active tile trigger is activated, go to the tiles controls located in the tool bar on the left hand side.</p></li><li><p>Left click to highlight, then right click to bring up the controls.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the Toggle Active State is highlighted.</p></li></ol><p>And that's it! You're now ready to run your characters through The Lost Tomb! We hope you enjoy it and we look forward to bringing more assets to life in the coming weeks and months! Stay tuned!</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Preload the scene so the triggers have time to load. There's quite a few of them. It'll glitch out if you don't. Secondly, give the tile enough time to deactivate before moving an actor onto it or it could the effects. The north one is set for 6 seconds, and the main room is set for 12 seconds so all the sounds and everything go off correctly. </p><p>The Gorgon and The Basilisk!</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Credits","type":"text","_id":"Jt4BKOtSSD3dzaVZ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Dyson Logos original layout: https://dysonlogos.blog/</p><p></p><p>Forgotten Adventures for the cartography assets:</p><p>https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/</p><p>https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"b6825df6df0746bce5dd7fb0ccd2e20c43767f5f","sourceId":"JournalEntry.Jzdw1SQkugRLYhoC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667015096048,"modifiedTime":1667183994592,"lastModifiedBy":"M0eHGYL5JPkZ8Fqg"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"M0eHGYL5JPkZ8Fqg":3},"_id":"Z3beY43mJfXjc11L"}
